The convolution operation is one of the fundamentals blocks of a CNN. One of the examples about convolution is the image edge detection operation.

Early layers of CNN might detect edges then the middle layers will detect parts of objects and the later layers will put the these parts together to produce an output.

In an image we can detect vertical edges, horizontal edges, or full edge detector.

Vertical edge detection:

An example of convolution operation to detect vertical edges:
