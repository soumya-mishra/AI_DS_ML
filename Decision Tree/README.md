* Classification & Regression Trees
* Leaves Represent class label
* Branches reresent conjuctions
* Based on Recursive partitioning
* it is Greedy algorithm
* ID3 | C4.5 | CART | CHAID Chi-square automatic interaction detection |MARS
* CHAID - Performs multi-level splits when computing classification trees
* MARS - extends decision trees to handle numerical data better
* Algorithms for constructing decision trees usually work top-down : 
* Gini impurity | Information gain
