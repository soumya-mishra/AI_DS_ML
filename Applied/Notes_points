Exploratory data analysis
imbalance & Banlanced dataset

2d scatter plot 
3d Scatter plot | what about 4d 5d - can human visualize ?- no
1D scaatter plot - can not read( can not see how many points are there for each class)

pair plot  -  seaborne  -  multiple plots for each pair of columns . ignore diagonal element 
Write observation after plotting 
more than 10 features - difficult to visualize and takes time

Histograms - PDF , CDF 
1D scaatter plot - can not read( can not see how many points are there for each class)
Hence we use Histogram for single feature instead of 1D plot 
Histogam - y axis says how mnay points exist -  smooth form inside a histogram is PDF (Probability Density function )
