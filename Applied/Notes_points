Exploratory data analysis
imbalance & Banlanced dataset

2d scatter plot 
3d Scatter plot | what about 4d 5d - can human visualize ?- no
1D scaatter plot - can not read( can not see how many points are there for each class)

pair plot  -  seaborne  -  multiple plots for each pair of columns . ignore diagonal element 
Write observation after plotting -  simple sentence - numeric value
more than 10 features - difficult to visualize and takes time

Univriate Analysis:
Histograms - PDF , CDF , Bins ( Binning )
1D scaatter plot - can not read( can not see how many points are there for each class)
Hence we use Histogram for single feature instead of 1D plot 
Histogam - y axis says how mnay points exist -  smooth form inside a histogram is PDF (Probability Density function )
CDF - cumulative Density Function ( Remember it is cumulative )
Imagine PDF and CDF 

Mean | Variance | Standard deviation 
Median  -  sort the values - and take the middle value ( Even and ODD no careful )
Median is robust to outliers 
if more than 50% of values are corrupted or outlier, then median is corrupted.
1, 1.1 , 1.2, 5, 10,20, 30 
what is median absolute deviation(MAD)  -  it is robust 

Perctiles: Percentages of points 
50th percintile say is 50% value is less than that value
basicallt 50th percitile is median
10th percintile is 105 value is less than that point. 25th 50th 75th percintiles are called Quartiles.

Box plot:  quartiles plot. 25th - 50th - 75th , Whiskers - shows the outliers
IQR = Q3 −  Q1
Q1 − 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR  are outliers or whiskers

Violin plot - looks like violine 
box plot plus Histogram and PDF is Violine plots

Multivariate Probability Density plot :
joint plot in seaborne, Contour plot 


Linear Algebra
2d - line
3d - plane , more than 3d it is hyperplane
Understand distance .  root{(x2^2 -x1^2) + (y2^2 - y1^2) + (z2^2 - z1^2)}  - 3D distance 
if through origine - one point will be zero

Distance:
Eucledian Distance
Minkowski distance | 1-norm distance	| 2 norm | n - norm 
Manhatten distance
Cosine distance
Levenshtein distance
Hamming distance

row vector and column vector. Default is column vector 
Projection 
Unit vector  a/||a||

Equation of a line  - ax+by+c = 0   |  wTX+w0 = 0 | y = mx+c 
plane = ax+by+cz+w0 = 0
hyperpalce  w1x1 + w2x2+w3x3+...+wnxn +w0 = 0

passing through origine means  c = 0 ( Y-intercept)

Circle: in 2d - x1 and x2 

x1^2 + x2^2+ ...+ Xn^2 = r^2 

Ellcipse equation: x1..xn
x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1
-------------------
Random variable X
Population, sample

Gaussian Distribution 
learn the equation 
68-95-99 rule 
 0 1 2 3 sigma( std)

symmetric distribution
Right skewed left skewed  ;  Kurtosis - peak 

standardize- x-mu/sigma   Z = N(0,1)  means 0 ,  1 std

Kernel Density Estimation :  density of ditribution . 

Sampling distribution : take sample from population  and see 

Central Limit Theorem:  take a random variable X , we do not know the distribution 
take the samples  at least 30 . Each sample has let say 1000 points.
callculate the sample mean for each sample

all sample means has a distribution . Draw the distributions. It follows Normal distibutions with same mean( mu) as population
Variance will be  Variance/n    -  n is no of samples. n = 30 .
